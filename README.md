### This is a readme text.
## Font operation  
- Bold text
- italic text  

I will use this to record my learning process about **Markdown**, and <strong> in HTML.  

This is *Italic*. And in HTML, we will use <em> </em>.  

If we want both, like ***this is the most important thing***!  

The following will be reference unit.
> Can you tell the difference?
If we want many paragraph, we shall add an ">" in the blank row.
> Hi!
>
> This is the second paragraph.
>> This is double built-in

## Ordered list

     - dis2

## Code section
If you want to represent code in Markdown, you can use back quote mark to include it, like `type`.  
As for code block, you need to retract at least **4** space or a **tab** in every row, like,
   <html>
      <p>Hello,world!</p>
   </html>
